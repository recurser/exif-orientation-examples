EXIF Orientation-flag example images
====================================

Example images using each of the EXIF orientation flags (0-to-8), in both landscape and portrait orientations.

Generating your own images
--------------------------

If you would like to generate test images based on your own photos, you can use the `generate.rb` script included in the `generator` folder.

The instructions below assume you are running on macOS - if not, you will need to install the Ghostscript fonts (`brew install gs`) some other way.

To install the dependencies:

```
> brew install gs exiftool imagemagick@6
> cd generator
> gem install bundler
> bundle install
```

To generate test images:

```
> cd generator
> ./generate.rb path/to/image.jpg
```

This will create images `image_0.jpg` through to `image_8.jpg`.

**Python alternative**
```
> cd generator
> python generator.py path/to/image.jpg
```

Re-generating sample images
---------------------------

Simply run `make` to regenerate the included sample images. This will download random portrait and landscape orientation images from [unsplash.com](https://unsplash.com/) and generate sample images for each of them.

Generating these images depends on having the generator dependencies installed - see the *Generating your own images* section for instructions on installing dependencies.
